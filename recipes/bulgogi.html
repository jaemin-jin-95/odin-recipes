      <!-- Describing the recipe -->
      <p class="description">
         Bulgogi (불고기) is a Korean dish of thinly sliced, marinated beef that is grilled or pan-fried. The name bulgogi literally means "fire meat" in Korean. Bulgogi is typically made with sirloin or other prime cuts of beef. The meat is sliced very thinly, almost translucently, so that it cooks quickly and evenly. The marinade for bulgogi is a sweet and savory mixture of soy sauce, sugar, garlic, ginger, and sesame oil. Some recipes also call for Asian pear or apple, which adds a touch of sweetness and acidity.<br><br>

         Bulgogi is typically grilled over a hot fire, but it can also be pan-fried or stir-fried. It is often served with rice, lettuce leaves, and other vegetables. Bulgogi can also be made with chicken or pork, but beef is the most traditional.<br><br>
         
         Bulgogi is a popular dish in Korea and is often served at barbecue restaurants. It is also a popular dish to make at home. Bulgogi is a delicious and versatile dish that can be enjoyed in a variety of ways.
