      <!-- Describing the recipe -->
      <p>
         Bulgogi, or Korean barbecued beef, is made with marinated sliced beef. Most recipes call for crushed pear to tenderize the meat. This recipe uses very thinly-sliced sirloin steak, so tenderization isn't necessary. It's delicious served with rice, lettuce leaves, and chile paste or kimchi.

         <li>2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds</li>
         <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
         <li>¼ teaspoon Korean red pepper flakes</li>
         <li>¼ teaspoon minced fresh ginger</li>

      <!-- Steps -->
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol class="steps">
         <li>Whisk soy sauce, white and light green parts of green onions, yellow onion, sugar, garlic, sesame seeds, sesame oil, red pepper flakes, ginger, and black pepper together in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add steak slices and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour, or up to 1 day.
         </li>
         <li>
            Heat a wok or large skillet over medium heat. Working in batches, cook and stir steak and marinade together in the hot skillet, adding honey to caramelize the steak, until steak is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Garnish bulgogi with dark green parts of green onions.
