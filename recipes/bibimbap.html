      <!-- Describing the recipe -->
      <p class="description">
         Bibimbap (비빔밥) is a Korean rice dish that literally means "mixed rice". It is a bowl of warm white rice topped with a variety of ingredients, such as namul (sautéed or blanched seasoned vegetables), gochujang (chili pepper paste), and gosari (dried seaweed). Egg and sliced meat (usually beef) are common additions, stirred together thoroughly just before eating.

      <!-- Steps -->
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol class="steps">
         <li>Stir together cucumber pieces and gochujang paste in a bowl; set aside.</li>
         <li>Bring about 2 cups water to a boil in a large nonstick skillet and stir in spinach; cook until bright green and wilted, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
         <li>Drain spinach and squeeze out as much moisture as possible; set spinach aside in a bowl and stir in soy sauce.</li>
         <li>Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large nonstick skillet; cook and stir carrots until softened, about 3 minutes.</li>
         <li>Stir in garlic and cook just until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in cucumber mixture; sprinkle with red pepper flakes. Set carrot mixture aside in a bowl.</li>
         <li>Brown beef in a clean nonstick skillet over medium heat, about 5 minutes per side; set aside.</li>
         <li>Heat remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil in another nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Fry eggs just on one side until yolks are runny, but whites are firm, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
         <li>Divide cooked rice into 4 large serving bowls; top with spinach mixture, a few pieces of beef, and cucumber mixture. Place 1 egg atop each serving. Drizzle each bowl with 1 teaspoon sesame oil, a sprinkle of sesame seeds, and a small amount of gochujang paste if desired.</li>
