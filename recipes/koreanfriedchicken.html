      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
         <li>Make marinade: Stir together chicken, onion, garlic, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until chicken is coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 4 hours to overnight.</li>
         <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 340 degrees F (171 degrees C).</li>
         <li>While oil is heating, make batter: Whisk together cornstarch, flour, sugar, pepper, and salt in a large bowl. Gradually whisk in cold water until mixture resembles smooth pancake batter. Use tongs to remove chicken from marinade to batter; stir to coat chicken completely. Discard marinade.</li>
         <li>Working in batches, fry chicken in hot oil for 4 minutes. Transfer chicken to a cooling rack.</li>
         <li>Increase oil temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
         <li>Working in batches, fry chicken again in hot oil until golden brown and crispy, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to drain.</li>
      </ol>
